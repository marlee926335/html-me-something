    <h1 class="title">Where I've Been</h2>
    <p>I've been several different areas of banking and finance.  From a teller to a call center rep, to a trader.

    <h1 class="title">Where I'm Going</h3>
        <p>My long term goal is to be software developer for Nike.  I'm passionate and loyal about the brand, and it'd be a dream come true.<br>
            To get there, I plan to complete the LC101 program, then move to an apprenticeship.  During the apprenticeship, I plan to learn as much <br>
            as possible, get as much as there is to gain from the apprenticeship, and build relationships w/ other developers.<br>
            Once the apprenticeship has reached an end, the next step would be to seek entry-level employment with a company<br>
            that can prepare me for a future role with Nike.
